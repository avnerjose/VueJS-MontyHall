# Monty Hall Problem 

This project is a MontyHall problem implementation using VueJS. This is not an original project, it is from Cod3r's Udemy course. 

## How does Monty Hall works? 

In this litle game you are suposed to choose de amount of doors you want to, and choose  the one that will have a gift inside.
After that, you can ask someone to choose one of the doors, the person needs to try to find the gift. 
Then you must open the doors and leave only two of them closed. One of the closed ones is the door the person you asked chose
and the other one is the one with the gift. If the person choose the door with the gift, choose another ramdom door to keep closed.

At the end of the game, you ask the person if it wants to keep with the door he choose or if he wants to change to the other door.
When the person finishes the choise, you open the door the person choose and show what is behind, if there is a gift, the person won the game, 
if the door is empty the person lost the game. 

The secret of this game if that most times, if you change you choice at the end you have bigger chances to win.
