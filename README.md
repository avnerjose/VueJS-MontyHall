# Monty Hall Problem 

This project is a MontyHall problem implementation using VueJS. This is not an original project, it is from Cod3r's Udemy course. 

##How does Monty Hall works? 

In this litle game you are suposed to choose de amount of doors you want to, and choose  the one that will have a gift inside.
After that, you can ask someone to choose one of the doors, the person needs to try to find the gift. 
Then you must open the doors and leave only two of them closed. One of the closed ones is the door the person you asked chose
and the other one is the one with the gift. If the person choose the door with the gift, choose another ramdom door to keep closed.
